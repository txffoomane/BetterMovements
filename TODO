Hello
I will describe here what I would like to do

-Camera tilts when turning the mouse and strafing (Completed)
-Player inertia (In progress)
-Ability to customize the mod through config files (Not started)
-Disable FOV changes when player speed changes(In progress)

Simply put, I want to implement movement like in the game Escape from Tarkov
